@theme @theme_snap
Feature: When the Moodle theme is set to Snap, the user profile picture should not be a link in the user profile page.

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | user1    | User      | 1        | user1@example.com    |

  @javascript
  Scenario: User picture in the user profile page should not be a link
    And I log in as "user1"
    And I open the personal menu
    And I follow "Profile"
    And "#page-user-profile div.page-header-image > a" "css_element" should not exist
    And "Dashboard" "link" should exist in the "#page-user-profile #page-header > div.breadcrumb-nav" "css_element"
